<h2>Bitcast</h2>
<p>Bitcast is a decentralized platform designed to incentivize content creators to connect brands with audiences by producing YouTube videos that fulfill specific briefs. Brands publish content briefs, and creators (miners) submit videos that meet these requirements, earning rewards based on genuine engagement metrics such as YouTube Premium revenue. Validators ensure the integrity of the system by verifying analytics data and disbursing on-chain rewards in the Bitcast Alpha token. The platform employs a multi-layered scoring and reward system to prioritize authentic engagement, prevent manipulation, and fairly distribute emissions, with mechanisms for anti-exploitation and transparent, industry-standard reward calculations.</p>
