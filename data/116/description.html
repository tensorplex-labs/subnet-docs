<h2>TaoLend</h2>
<p>TaoLend is a decentralized lending protocol designed for the Bittensor ($TAO) ecosystem, enabling users to lend TAO and allowing borrowers to secure loans using subnet ALPHA as collateral. The protocol features point-to-point lending, flexible interest rates set by lenders, and permissionless transactions via smart contracts. TaoLend incentivizes both lenders and depositors with ALPHA rewards, distributed based on actual lending activity and deposit balances, while maintaining ALPHA staked within the subnet to enhance network security and capital efficiency. The platform aims to deepen integration between Bittensor and the broader DeFi landscape, offering a web interface for all operations and a transparent, anti-manipulation reward mechanism.</p>
