<h2>Trajectory RL</h2>

<p>
  trajectoryrl is a Bittensor subnet (subnet 11) providing reinforcement
  learning as a service, where miners compete to optimize AI agent policy packs
  for real-world operational tasks. Validators deterministically evaluate
  submitted policy packs using fixed scenarios (via clawbench), rewarding those
  that are safer, more efficient, and more reliable. The project emphasizes
  safety-first scoring, deterministic evaluation (avoiding LLM judge
  randomness), and strong anti-copy incentives, including GitHub-based timestamp
  verification and a winner-take-all reward structure. Real-world scenarios
  include tasks like email triage, incident response, and task delegation, with
  a focus on making agent behaviors cheaper, safer, and more robust.
