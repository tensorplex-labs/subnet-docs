  Picture this: You&#39;re already trading on prediction markets, making calls
  on whether your favorite team will win or if that political candidate will
  pull through. Now imagine getting <strong>paid in TAO/alpha</strong> just for
  doing what you&#39;re already doing. That&#39;s <strong>Wahooτ</strong> – we
  took the prediction markets you love and added a Bittensor rewards layer on
  top.
</p>
<p>Just trade, perform well, and watch the rewards come in.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-wahoo-">What is Wahooτ?</h3>
<p>
  Wahooτ is where the action happens. You&#39;re trading on what people
  <em>actually</em> think is going to happen – in real-time. Politics, sports,
  economics, you name it. It&#39;s like having a front-row seat to the
  world&#39;s collective gut feeling, and you can bet on it.
</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what makes it awesome:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Live markets</strong> on literally everything – from &quot;Will it
    rain tomorrow?&quot; to &quot;Will Bitcoin hit $100k?&quot;
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dead simple Yes/No bets</strong> – no complex derivatives, no
    confusing options
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Odds that move in real-time</strong> – watch the market react to
    news as it breaks
  </li>
  <li><strong>Trade from anywhere</strong> – just open your browser and go</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Want to automate?</strong> Full API access for the power users
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-it-all-works-together">How It All Works Together</h3>
<p>
  Okay, here&#39;s the deal: You don&#39;t need to understand blockchain, APIs,
  or any of that stuff. But if you&#39;re the curious type (we like you),
  here&#39;s what happens behind the curtain:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>You register</strong> – Link your Bittensor wallet to Wahooτ
    (seriously, 2 minutes max)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>You trade</strong> – Do your thing on Wahooτ like you always do
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>We track</strong> – Our validators peek at your performance through
    the Wahooτ API (don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s all public data)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>You get scored</strong> – Based on how much you trade, how much you
    profit, and how often you&#39;re right
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>You earn TAO/alpha</strong> – Rewards hit your miner wallet based on
    your actual trading chops
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>The formula is simple:</strong> Better trades = More rewards. More
  trades = More rewards. It&#39;s all about your real performance, not some
  abstract code test.

  Why Wahooτ is Revolutionary for Bittensor
</h3>
<p>
  Let&#39;s be real – most Bittensor subnets read like a computer science
  textbook. You need to know Python, understand neural networks, and probably
  have a server running 24/7.
  <strong>We said &quot;nah&quot; to all of that.</strong>
</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what makes us different:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    ✅ <strong>Literally zero coding</strong> – If you can click &quot;Yes&quot;
    or &quot;No&quot; on a prediction, you&#39;re qualified
  </li>
  <li>
    ✅ <strong>Real money, real performance</strong> – We reward actual trading
    skills, not your ability to write a script. Got previously experience with
    automated trading? Then that&#39;s only an advantage over your
    competetition.
  </li>
  <li>
    ✅ <strong>Built on something that works</strong> – Wahooτ is already live
    and thriving. We just added the rewards layer
  </li>
  <li>
    ✅ <strong>Nothing to hide</strong> – Your performance is public, so you can
    see exactly why you&#39;re earning what you&#39;re earning
  </li>
</ul>
