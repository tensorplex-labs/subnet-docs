  Loosh AI: The Robot’s Second Brain and Conscience
</h2>
<h3 id="product-mission">Product Mission</h3>
<p>
  Loosh AI addresses the limitations of current shallow AI models by providing a
  &quot;second brain&quot; focused on memory, moral tradeoffs, and autonomous
  decision-making. The platform is designed for AI agents in customer-facing
  roles, regulated workflows, and embodied robots operating in human spaces.
</p>
<h3 id="system-architecture">System Architecture</h3>
<p>
  The platform utilizes a three-part architecture designed to maintain a rich,
  time-aware model of information, intent, and state changes.
</p>
<p><strong>Core Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Cognitive System</li>
  <li>Context Builder</li>
  <li>Memory Fabric</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>The Temporal Knowledge Graph:</strong> As agents gain experience, the
  system generates a graph that is continually rewritten and re-weighted. This
  ensures agents reason over a causally consistent view of the world while
  improving capabilities by reflecting on past experiences.
</p>
<h3 id="cognitive-services-ethics">Cognitive Services &amp; Ethics</h3>
<p>
  Loosh differentiates itself through specialized evaluators that function as an
  integrated moral compass to ensure predictable, safe, and trustworthy
  behavior.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Rights &amp; Deontic Evaluators:</strong> Assess proposed actions
      based on established rules, duties, and rights.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Virtue &amp; Utility Evaluators:</strong> Weigh the moral
      character and potential outcomes of decisions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Future Capabilities:</strong> Feasibility assessment, fact
      analysis, planning, sensibility, and reflection.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multimodal-inference-human-alignment">
  Multimodal Inference &amp; Human Alignment
</h3>
<p>
  To support true autonomy, the system is designed to infer human intent and
  emotional state through language and nonverbal communication. This foundation
  allows for the creation of expressive, emotionally rich personas.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Input Channels:</strong> Audio, Video, and EEG
      (Electroencephalography).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Function:</strong> Identifies human emotions to align robotic
      behavior with human needs.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="infrastructure-scaling">Infrastructure &amp; Scaling</h3>
<p>
  Loosh leverages decentralized infrastructure to scale its &quot;Machine
  Consciousness&quot; architecture.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Bittensor Protocol:</strong> Utilizes a decentralized network of
      global GPUs for distributed computing power.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Training Data:</strong> AI models are trained against inference,
      emotional, and cognitive data.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Yuma Subnet Accelerator:</strong> As part of the Yuma accelerator
      (a DCG subsidiary), Loosh utilizes validator support and capital to build
      within the Bittensor ecosystem.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="integration-use-cases">Integration &amp; Use Cases</h3>
<p>
  The platform is built for robotics companies and firms deploying advanced AI
  agents.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Integration Points:</strong> Works with World Models and existing
      AI stacks.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Deliverables:</strong> Provides persistent memory, semantically
      searchable context, and a built-in moral compass.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Goal:</strong> Enabling agents to reason like humans rather than
      stateless tools.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
