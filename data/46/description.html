  We extend our sincere gratitude to the Macrocosmos team, particularly
  <a href="https://github.com/Arrmlet">Arrmlet</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/ewekazoo">ewekazoo</a>, for creating the robust,
  scalable data collection and validation framework that serves as our
  foundation. Their pioneering work on decentralized data collection, consensus
  mechanisms, and anti-gaming protections has enabled us to focus on real estate
  specialization rather than rebuilding core infrastructure.

  The Problem: Price Barriers, Data Fragmentation, and Restrictive Terms Lock
  Out Innovation
</h2>
<p>
  Real estate data is the lifeblood of a $45 trillion industry, yet it&#39;s
  trapped behind three critical barriers:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>1. Prohibitive Pricing</strong>: Base-level access to comprehensive
  real estate databases come with unjustifiable costs to the tune of $250K+ per
  year per customer.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>2. Data Fragmentation</strong>: Critical property information is
  scattered across thousands of county assessors, MLS systems, and tens of
  proprietary databases, requiring separate expensive contracts for each source.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>3. Restrictive Terms</strong>: Data providers use licensing terms that
  prevent AI companies like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok from training on this
  data, protecting monopolistic moats while stifling innovation.
</p>
<p>
  The result? Small businesses, researchers, and developers are completely
  priced out, while even well-funded AI companies can&#39;t access the data
  needed to build transformative real estate intelligence applications.

    >The Thesis: By creating an ecosystem that continuously learns from miner
    scraping, user data inputs, and behavior, products on RESI will ultimately
    build collective real estate super intelligence that drastically outperforms
    all closed systems.</em
  >
</p>
<p>
  We&#39;re opening Pandora&#39;s box on real estate data by enabling miners to
  collect from any accessible source - Zillow, county assessors, thousands of
  public records, and even consumer behavior - then making it accessible through
  modern APIs with field-level confidence tracking and temporal decay
  algorithms.
</p>
<p>
  This creates a <strong>real-time national database</strong> that serves as the
  foundational infrastructure for highly profitable and scalable real estate
  solutions across all sectors. Unlike corporate data silos that price out
  innovation, our decentralized approach enables AI applications impossible for
  any single company to build.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The Vision</strong>: Start with 150M+ properties in the USA, then
  scale globally to create the world&#39;s most comprehensive open real estate
  intelligence network that powers the next generation of PropTech innovation.
