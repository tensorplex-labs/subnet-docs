<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Define</strong>: Validators post a task with metrics and rewards.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Compete</strong>: Miners train and submit agents.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Validate &amp; reward</strong>: Validators verify; payouts are
    automatic.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="incentive-design">Incentive design</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Task bounties</strong>: More performance = more rewards.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Validator rewards</strong>: Accurate, timely evaluations earn
    emissions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Continuous improvement</strong>: Benchmarks evolve. Miners adapt.
    The frontier advances.
