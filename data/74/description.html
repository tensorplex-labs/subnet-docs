<h2>Gittensor</h2>
<p>Gittensor is a Bittensor subnet designed to incentivize open source software development by rewarding meaningful contributions to recognized repositories. Contributors, known as miners, earn TAO tokens when their pull requests are merged into whitelisted projects. The system uses semantic code analysis and repository weighting to ensure rewards are distributed based on the quality and impact of contributions, not just quantity. Validators authenticate contributions and manage scoring, creating a sybil-resistant, sustainable incentive layer for open source development.</p>
