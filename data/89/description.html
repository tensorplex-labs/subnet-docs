<h2>InfiniteHash</h2>
<p>Infinitehash subnet (sn89) is a decentralized Bitcoin mining pool that integrates advanced Lightning Network infrastructure to create a more democratic and sustainable mining ecosystem. The project incentivizes miners by rewarding them with alpha tokens proportional to their contributed hashrate, with all mined Bitcoin converted to alpha and burned to maintain buying pressure. Infinitehash aims to establish Bitcoin as the preferred payment layer for the emerging AI agent economy, while also introducing mechanisms to ensure sustainable mining economics and encourage miners to operate Lightning nodes for additional rewards.</p>
