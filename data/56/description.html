<h2>Gradients</h2>
<p>The Gradients On Demand (g.o.d) subnet is a distributed platform designed for large language model (LLM) and diffusion model training through competitive tournaments. Participants, known as miners, submit open-source AutoML training scripts that are executed by validators on dedicated infrastructure. Tournaments run for 4-7 days, with new events starting 72 hours after the previous one ends. Top performers receive exponentially higher reward weights, and winning scripts are made publicly available. The project emphasizes open-source collaboration, reproducible results, and provides detailed guides for miners and validators, as well as technical documentation on reward functions and safe code execution.</p>
