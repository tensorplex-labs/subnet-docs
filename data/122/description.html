<p>Common objectives shared by merchants:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Increase add to carts (engagement)</li>
  <li>
    Increase the number of customers who complete an order (conversion rate)
  </li>
  <li>Increase the average size of cart (average order value)</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The subnet miners are incentivized to try to maximize the goals for online
  merchants using <em>existing store data and traffic</em> (onsite).
</p>
<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>
  Global e-commerce is an estimated 20T market with a ~15% CAGR. A large portion
  of online sales are directly attributed to onsite recommendations (e.g
  customers who bought x also bought y, bundled products, last minute checkout
  items etc). Famously, Amazon attributes 35% of their total online sales to
  their proprietary recommendation engine. Unfortunately this engine is out of
  reach for most online retailers who are operating on smaller platforms (e.g
  Shopify, Woocommerce etc) which have their own recommendation solutions and
  widgets, often using older rules-based technology.
</p>
<p>
  This problem is a subset of the much larger General Recommendations space
  which powers most of the Internet today (e.g Netflix movie recommendations,
  TikTok reels, Google search suggestions, etc)
</p>
<p>
  We are addressing a more narrow but vital area of e-commerce -

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>
  Incentivize Bittensor miners to provide realtime product recommendations for
  online merchants.
</p>
<p>
  The first generation solution uses prompting and ICL via a Voting Ensemble
  method to coerce recs from the latest LLMs. We explore dozens of LLMs and
  measure their &quot;agreement&quot; via sku recommendations they produce in
  zero-shot queries. These recs make their way back to client websites for the
  end user (the shopper) to consume.

</p>
<p>
  0.8 uses a simple prompt template that we hope to evolve into a fully featured
  recommender as the network matures. Additionally, many LLM&#39;s have encoded
  valuable information about shopping cohorts, seasonality, brand affinities,
  customer journeys etc which we try to unlock using prompting.
</p>
<p>
  The solution has been designed to offer merchants a free and simple plugin
  that works out of the box, while hiding all the complexity and abstractions of
  Bittensor away from them so they can continue to focus on selling and running
  an online business. Subnet miners can focus on competing and evolving the
  prompting to produce increasingly valuable and timely product recommendations.
</p>
<p>
  Validators provide the gateway to the miners, which send and collect requests
  through the network, scoring them and selecting a top candidate to return to
  the client.
