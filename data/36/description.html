  <strong>Web Agents Subnet</strong> leverages our
  <strong>Infinite Web Arena (IWA)</strong> benchmark to incentivize
  <strong>Bittensor Miners</strong> to develop powerful
  <strong>Web Agents</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Current state-of-the-art benchmarks for web operation are quite limited and
  can be easily gamed by memorization and training on the dataset.
  <strong>IWA</strong> solves these limitations by using
  <strong>generative AI</strong> and <strong>synthetic data</strong> to create a
  continuous stream of <strong>novel and dynamic web challenges</strong>. This
  approach ensures agents face realistic tasks that demand ongoing adaptation,
  reasoning, and generalization.
</p>
<p>
  Our goal is to make <strong>IWA</strong> the default benchmark for web agents
  and establish <strong>Subnet 36 web agents</strong> as the world&#39;s best
  web operators. By rewarding miners who develop high-performing agents,
  <strong>IWA</strong> ensures scalability, continuous improvement, and robust
  evaluations without static datasets or human bottlenecks.
