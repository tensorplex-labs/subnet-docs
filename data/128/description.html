<h2>ByteLeap</h2>
<p>Byteleap Miner is the resource aggregation component of the Byteleap distributed compute platform, operating on the Bittensor sn128 compute network. It enables users to connect miners that aggregate and manage up to 100 worker nodes, facilitating the leasing of computational resources through an integrated marketplace. Miners earn rewards based on active compute rentals and sustained availability, with a scoring system that incentivizes uptime and resource utilization. The architecture features a three-tier system comprising validators for coordination, miners for aggregation and network interfacing, and workers for executing compute tasks. The platform emphasizes modular deployment, secure communication, and efficient resource management.</p>
