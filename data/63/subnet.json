  "summary": "Quantum Innovate (SN63) is a Bittensor subnet dedicated to fostering innovation in quantum computing algorithm execution. Miners are challenged with synthetic quantum circuits, such as peaked circuits, HStab circuits, and upcoming Shor's algorithm-based tasks, to push the boundaries of quantum circuit execution through pre-processing, simulator selection, simulation efficiency, and post-processing.",
