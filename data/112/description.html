<h2>minotaur</h2>
<p>Minotaur is a distributed DEX aggregator and swap intent solver engine operating as Bittensor subnet 112. It optimizes and executes user-submitted swap intents by leveraging a competitive solver (miner) ecosystem, where solvers compete in real-time to deliver the best trade execution in terms of price, speed, and reliability. The system features deterministic scoring, cryptographic accountability, and tempo-aware emissions, ensuring transparent and fair reward distribution. Validators replay and verify execution histories, while settlement contracts enforce constraints and handle token transfers. Minotaur aims to reduce user fees, improve trade outcomes, and extend cross-chain liquidity access through practical optimization tools and a robust incentive mechanism.</p>
