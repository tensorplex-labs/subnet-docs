<h2>HODL - The ETF Subnet</h2>
<p>hodl - the etf subnet is a project designed to incentivize long-term conviction among participants by offering an ETF-like structure within the Bittensor ecosystem. The subnet enables users to stake tokens and earn emissions based on both the amount and duration of their stake, with a unique scoring formula that rewards longer commitments. The roadmap includes the launch of the hodl ETF, followed by an ETF exchange and the introduction of futures and options, with transaction fees from these products being used for automatic buybacks. The project emphasizes non-custodial staking through trusted indexes and prioritizes security and fairness in its operations.</p>
