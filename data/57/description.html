<h2>
  Sparket.AI: Decentralized prediction infrastructure for sports and live
  events.
</h2>
<p>
  Sparket.ai is a decentralized prediction infrastructure focused on sports and
  live events, operating as the first Bittensor subnet built on a patented
  architecture for decentralized betting markets. The platform enables
  participants to contribute data—such as odds origination and outcome
  verification—to the markets they wager in, rewarding miners for providing
  valuable and accurate live-event data. Its patented system covers custom bet
  creation, dynamic odds, data normalization, and trust-scored outcome
  verification, supporting a global network of miners and validators. Real-money
  wagering is planned for future phases, with the current beta supporting data
  contribution and validation tasks to power the Sparket ecosystem.
