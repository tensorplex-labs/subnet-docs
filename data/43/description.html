<h2>Graphite</h2>
<p>GraphiteAI is a decentralized network built on Bittensor, specializing in solving complex graph optimization problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). By leveraging decentralized intelligence and scalable computational power, Graphite connects miners and validators to efficiently process and solve NP-hard graph challenges. The platform supports multiple input methods and provides a suite of algorithms, including heuristics and deep learning-based approaches, while incentivizing miners to develop high-performance solvers through a reward mechanism. GraphiteAI aims to democratize access to advanced graph solutions, making them accessible to both individuals and organizations through an intuitive interface and comprehensive support.</p>
