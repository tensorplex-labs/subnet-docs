<p>Taonado.cash is a zero-knowledge-based token mixer for the Bittensor ($TAO) ecosystem, inspired by Tornado Cash. It enables users to deposit and withdraw TAO tokens with full anonymity, breaking the on-chain link between sender and receiver addresses. The platform leverages zk-SNARKs for privacy, offers flexible deposit pools, and incentivizes participation through rewards for liquidity provision and network security contributions. Taonado introduces novel mechanisms like Anonymous Incentive (AI) and Anti-Monitoring Liquidity (AML) to enhance privacy and liquidity, while integrating seamlessly with Bittensor subnets. The project operates without traditional validators, allowing any EVM wallet to contribute to validation and earn rewards.</p>
