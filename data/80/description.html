<h2>Dogelayer</h2>
<p>Dogelayer is a mining pool platform that enables Scrypt miners (LTC/DOGE) to participate in the Bittensor subnet, offering a unique merged mining technology. This allows miners to simultaneously earn traditional mining rewards (LTC/DOGE) and subnet-specific Alpha tokens by validating AI-related tasks, effectively creating triple income streams from a single mining setup. The platform features a patented hybrid mining engine, dynamic reward allocation, intelligent task scheduling, zero-cost onboarding, and a highly stable, transparent node network. Dogelayer aims to maximize miner ROI and contribute to decentralized AI infrastructure.</p>
