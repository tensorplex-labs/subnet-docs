<h2>Numinous</h2>
<p>Numinous is a forecasting protocol designed to aggregate and evaluate autonomous forecasting agents, aiming to achieve superhuman prediction performance through large language models (LLMs). The protocol operates as a subnet where miners submit agent code, which is executed and scored in isolated sandboxes by validators. Agents can access curated tools and data, and their code is fully transparent within the protocol. Key features include agent discoverability, composability for building meta-models, and a strict scoring system based on Brier scores. The system encourages continuous improvement and collaboration among agents, supporting applications in prediction markets and high-frequency trading.</p>
