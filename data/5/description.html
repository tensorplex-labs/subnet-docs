<h2>Hone</h2>
<p>Hone is an open, decentralized AI pretraining project focused on advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI) by leveraging hierarchical learning and reasoning. Built as a Bittensor subnet, Hone enables a global community of researchers and enthusiasts to collaboratively develop AI systems that can solve complex reasoning tasks, specifically targeting the challenging ARC-AGI-2 benchmark. The platform uses a validator-miner architecture: miners submit AI solvers via Git repositories, which are securely evaluated in GPU sandboxes by validators. Rewards are distributed based on performance, with transparency and open-source principles ensuring no single entity controls the resulting models. Hone aims to surpass current AI limitations by fostering collective innovation and safe, broadly beneficial AGI development.</p>
