<h2>Templar</h2>
<p>τemplar is a decentralized framework designed to enable large-scale AI model training across diverse and distributed compute resources on the internet. By coordinating miners (who train models on assigned data and share gradients) and validators (who evaluate and score these contributions), τemplar incentivizes honest and high-quality participation through a blockchain-based reward mechanism. The system supports heterogeneous hardware, scalable architecture, and incorporates advanced techniques such as gradient compression and fair data assignment. Currently, τemplar is in a 100% burn period with no emissions, and is preparing to launch &#x27;templar: crusades&#x27;, a competitive system for optimizing training code.</p>
