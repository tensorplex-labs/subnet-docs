<h2>Mainframe</h2>
<p>Macrocosmos&#x27; Subnet 25 (Mainframe) is a decentralized scientific computing platform built on Bittensor, focused on leveraging distributed GPU compute for complex life sciences problems, starting with protein folding and protein-ligand docking—key processes in drug discovery. By incentivizing miners to deliver optimal molecular configurations using industry-standard tools like GROMACS and OpenMM, Mainframe reduces computational costs and accelerates research for academia, biotech, and pharma. The platform is expanding to support a broader range of scientific computation tasks, including density functional theory (DFT), and has already completed hundreds of thousands of protein-folding jobs since its June 2024 launch. Strategic partnerships, such as with Rowan Scientific, further enhance its capabilities in AI-driven chemistry and drug development.</p>
