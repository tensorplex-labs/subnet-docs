  Subnet 25, Mainframe (formerly known as Protein-Folding) is the first
  decentralized science subnet on Bittensor. Its focus is on creating DeSci
  technology for pharmaceutical companies, researchers, and academics.
  Presently, its focus is on using global computing power to simulate protein
  molecular dynamics via OpenMM, and protein-ligand docking using DiffDock; both
  processes essential in most drug discovery pipelines. However, this subnet is
  designed to be adaptive to a wide array of computing-based problems in the
  life sciences, utilizing Bittensorâ€™s tokenomics and incentive structure to
  offer affordable solutions.

  Mainframe asks a simple question: can a decentralized, incentivized pool of
  people be used for generalized scientific compute? At Macrocosmos, we believe
  it is possible. Not only that, we believe that decentralized and accessible
  in-silico experimentation is imperative to accelerate science.

  &quot;Rational simulation-guided design of atomic systems has been a dream of
  researchers across the chemical sciences for decades. Enabling rapid and
  performant experimentation to experts would unlock massive potential to
  accelerate chemical science&quot;
