<p>Natix Network leverages a global, crowdsourced camera network—powered by dashcams, smartphones, and specialized devices like the VX360—to collect anonymized real-world visual and geospatial data. This data is used to advance autonomous driving, physical AI, and dynamic map-making by enabling AI-powered detection of features such as construction sites. Participants can monetize their camera footage via apps or devices, earning rewards in the $NATIX token. The network employs advanced AI-based anonymization for privacy, and utilizes a decentralized incentive mechanism to ensure data quality and continuous model improvement. Natix is built on platforms like Solana and Bittensor, and partners with major automotive and mapping stakeholders.</p>
