  ALPHA is a TAO subnet delivering real-time, verifiable crypto market data
  through decentralized AI research agents.
</p>
<p>
  Agents continuously source, validate, and publish live price feeds and
  holdings data—anchored on-chain for treasury managers, analysts, and protocol
  developers.

  <strong>🌍 Vision: Verifiable Intelligence for a Crypto-Native World</strong>
</h2>
<p>
  The future of finance is autonomous. But autonomy without auditability is
  dangerous.
</p>
<p>ALPHA brings together two critical forces:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      AI – For intelligence at scale: parsing filings, scanning chains,
      ingesting global market signals.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Crypto – For trust without centralization: publishing data verifiably,
      with transparent incentives.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In a world where opaque models make consequential decisions, we don’t just
  ask: “what’s the output?”
</p>
<p>We ask: “can it be proven?”</p>
<p>ALPHA is designed to be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A decentralized research network of real-time agents</li>
  <li>A verifiable oracle layer for crypto data</li>
  <li>
    A system where data is sourced, not claimed—then verified, not trusted
  </li>
</ul>
