<h1 id="chipforge-sn84-">ChipForge (SN84)</h1>
<p>
  ChipForge (SN84) introduces the first digital design subnet for decentralized
  hardware innovation. This subnet enables miners to compete in designing real
  silicon. Processor development is organized into on-chain challenges —
  spanning AI accelerators, cryptographic modules, mini-GPUs, and other critical
  components. Participants download specifications, leverage AI tools, and
  submit complete Verilog/SystemVerilog implementations. The highest-quality
  designs earn rewards while contributing to fully manufacturable chips.
</p>
<p>
  In the short term, ChipForge focuses on advancing digital hardware design,
  with future applications across IoT, robotics, edge devices, and post-quantum
  security. Our roadmap includes progressing from design to full-scale
  fabrication within a year. Revenue from design IPs and fabricated chips will
  be reinvested into the ecosystem, ensuring sustainable value creation. Backed
  by the Tatsu validator team and open to strategic partnerships, ChipForge
  marks the beginning of a new era — decentralized, collaborative, and on-chain
  digital design.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>ChipForge operates as a competitive platform where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Miners</strong> submit hardware design solutions
    (Verilog/SystemVerilog)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Validators</strong> evaluate submissions using industry-standard EDA
    tools (Verilator, Yosys, Icarus, Openlane)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Challenges</strong> are rotated periodically with different design
    requirements
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Rewards</strong> are distributed based on performance metrics and
    competitive scoring - This is a winner-takes-all reward mechanism
  </li>
</ul>
