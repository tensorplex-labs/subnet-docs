  The Synth Subnet leverages Bittensor’s decentralized intelligence network to
  create the world&#39;s most powerful synthetic data for price forecasting.
  Unlike traditional price prediction systems that focus on single-point
  forecasts, Synth specializes in capturing the full distribution of possible
  price movements and their associated probabilities, to build the most accurate
  synthetic data in the world.
</p>
<p>
  Miners in the network are tasked with generating multiple simulated price
  paths, which must accurately reflect real-world price dynamics including
  volatility clustering and fat-tailed distributions. Their predictions are
  evaluated using the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), which measures
  both the calibration and sharpness of their forecasts against actual price
  movements.

<p>
  Validators score miners on short-term and long-term prediction accuracy, with
  recent performance weighted more heavily through an exponential decay
  function. Daily emissions are allocated based on miners’ relative performance,
  creating a competitive environment that rewards consistent accuracy.

  The Synth Subnet aims to become a key source of synthetic price data for AI
  Agents and the go-to resource for options trading and portfolio management,
  offering valuable insights into price probability distributions.
