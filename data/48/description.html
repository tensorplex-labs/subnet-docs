<h2>Quantum Compute</h2>
<p>Qbittensor Labs, through its Quantum Compute (sn48) and Quantum Innovate (sn63) subnets, is democratizing access to quantum computing by integrating real quantum hardware and high-performance simulation into the Bittensor ecosystem. The project enables researchers, developers, enterprises, and enthusiasts to run quantum circuits on physical quantum processors or simulators, often for free or at subsidized rates, via the Open Quantum platform. It features a two-sided marketplace connecting quantum hardware providers with users, supports seamless integration with popular quantum frameworks, and incentivizes innovation through challenges and rewards. The initiative aims to accelerate quantum algorithm development and real-world application by lowering barriers to entry and fostering a global, community-driven quantum ecosystem.</p>
