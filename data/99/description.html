  Neza shards advanced generation models like WAN2.1 across the network.
  Validators publish workflows, miners execute them to generate videos, and
  validators then assess output quality and distribute rewardsâ€”together forming
  a scalable, trustworthy ecosystem for on-demand AI video production.
