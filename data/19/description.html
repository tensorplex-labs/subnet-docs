<p>
  Blockmachine is a Bittensor subnet under active development, aiming to provide
  production-grade infrastructure with a focus on measurable work and real
  demand. Designed to function like a real business, it leverages
  Bittensor&#x27;s incentive layer to create self-optimizing infrastructure. The
  project is currently progressing through key milestones such as subnet
  identity and key migration, with plans to release detailed documentation,
  onboarding guides, reference implementations, and a public roadmap in upcoming
  updates.
