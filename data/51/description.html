  The Compute Subnet on Bittensor is a decentralized network that allows miners
  to contribute their GPU resources to a global pool. Users can rent these
  resources for computational tasks, such as machine learning, data analysis,
  and more. The system ensures fair compensation for miners based on the quality
  and performance of their GPUs.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Miners</strong>: Provide GPU resources to the network, evaluated and
    scored by validators.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Validators</strong>: Securely connect to miner machines to verify
    hardware specs and performance. They maintain the network&#39;s integrity.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Renters</strong>: Rent computational resources from the network to
    run their tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Frontend (lium.io)</strong>: The web interface facilitating easy
    interaction between miners and renters.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Bittensor Network</strong>: The decentralized blockchain in which
    the compensation is managed and paid out by the validators to the miners
    through its native token, $TAO.
  </li>
</ul>
