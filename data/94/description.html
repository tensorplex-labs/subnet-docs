<h2>BITSOTA</h2>
<p>bitsota is a decentralized research network built on Bittensor that enables the collaborative evolution of machine learning algorithms through competitive optimization. The platform is problem-agnostic, supporting both direct and pool mining modes, where miners use genetic programming to develop algorithms and validators independently evaluate submissions, distributing rewards via smart contract voting. Inspired by projects like AutoML-Zero and Goedel Machines, bitsota leverages blockchain incentives and cryptoeconomic mechanisms to drive continuous, open research and self-improving AI, with a focus on scalability and inclusivity for participants with varying hardware capabilities.</p>
