  Oceans is on a mission to transform bittensor pools into oceans. We will use
  bittensor incentives to channel liquidity to where it is most productive.
  Subnet liquidity has been a huge issue in Bittensor and we want to solve it.

<h3 id="key-components-">Key Components:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>🗳️ Holders of sn66 alpha</strong> - Vote (with their vote
      relevance determined by their sn66 α-Stake) and decide to which bittensor
      subnet miners should provide liquidity to.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>⛏️ Miners of sn66</strong> - Provide liquidity to bittensor
      subnets and will be rewarded depending on the amount of liquidity provided
      and the weight of each subnet determined by the votes of the sn66 holders.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reward-factors-">Reward Factors:</h3>
<p>
  <strong>📊 Liquidity Amount</strong><br />How much liquidity they provide to
  the pools, measured as the total value in USD of their positions
</p>
<p>
  <strong>🎯 Pool Selection</strong><br />Whether the pools they supply were
  selected by the α-Stake voting of the holders
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The result is an incentivized system that continually redirects liquidity
    toward the pools most valued by the community.
