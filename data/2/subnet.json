  "summary": "Subnet 2 represents a significant stride in enhancing the Bittensor network, aiming to create the world's largest peer-to-peer Verified Intelligence network, by building a Proof-of-Inference system for the Bittensor network. This initiative aligns with the Opentensor foundation's criteria for innovative subnet solutions. zk-ML allows AI models to be converted into a unique 'fingerprint,' a circuit that can be used to verify that a model's prediction was generated by a specific AI model, thereby providing what we term as Proof-of-Inference.",
