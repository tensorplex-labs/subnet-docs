  Subnet 2 represents a significant stride in enhancing the Bittensor network,
  aiming to create the world&#39;s largest peer-to-peer
  <strong>Verified</strong> Intelligence network, by building a
  Proof-of-Inference system for the Bittensor network. This initiative aligns
  with the Opentensor foundation&#39;s criteria for innovative subnet solutions.
  zk-ML allows AI models to be converted into a unique &#39;fingerprint,&#39; a
  circuit that can be used to verify that a model&#39;s prediction was generated
  by a specific AI model, thereby providing what we term as Proof-of-Inference.

  Incentive Mechanism and Reward Structure
</h3>
<p>
  Subnet 2 incentivizes miners and validators on Subnet 2 to contribute to the
  generation and validation of high-quality, secure, and efficient verified AI
  predictions using a specialized reward mechanism that aligns with the unique
  aspects of zero-knowledge machine learning (zk-ML) and decentralized AI.
  Currently Zero-knowledge proofs are generally more CPU computationally
  intensive and opens the opportunity for non-GPU miners to participate however
  the end goal is to further incentivize the development of proving systems
  optimized for GPU based operations. The incentives are based around Miners
  creating succinct and efficient models which can be circuitized with a
  zero-knowledge proving system.
</p>
<p>
  The reward mechanism for Subnet 2 scores the initial AI predictions based on
  the cryptographic integrity and time to generate zk-proofs along with the
  outputs, rather than solely on end results. This approach reduces the
  computational burden on validators as zk-proofs confirm the source model and
  integrity of AI predictions efficiently.
