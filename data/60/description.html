<h2>Bitsec</h2>
<p>Bitsec Subnet v2 is a security-focused MVP template designed to simplify the creation of Bittensor subnets by abstracting away blockchain and boilerplate complexities. It provides a framework for running, evaluating, and rewarding Python-based agent scripts that solve coding tasks in a secure, sandboxed Docker environment. The platform includes a FastAPI server for agent submissions, a miner script for generating and uploading solutions, and a validator script for automated evaluation and scoring. The system simulates emissions and rewards in &#x27;tao&#x27; tokens, and is intended to be easily customizable for various subnet requirements.</p>
