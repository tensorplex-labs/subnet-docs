<h2>Subnet 126</h2>
<p>Poker44 is a Bittensor subnet focused on adversarial bot detection in competitive environments, starting with online poker. It provides a decentralized, AI-powered platform where miners develop and submit behavioral models to detect bots, while validators objectively evaluate these models using real gameplay data within trusted execution environments (TEEs). The system ensures human-only gameplay by leveraging encrypted runtimes, remote attestation, and on-chain settlement via EVM smart contracts. Poker44 is designed as security infrastructure, generating high-quality, ground-truth datasets and continuously improving detection through open competition, with the long-term goal of expanding behavior validation across digital ecosystems.</p>
