  Babelbit is a subnet which is developing low-latency speech-to-speech
  translation. We are working on the principle that as well as all the latency
  which is caused by speech encoding and synthesis, there have traditionally
  been hard limits on the latency of translating the language itself. That is,
  it is often not clear what a sentence means until you have the whole thing.
  This is especially true with languages where the word order rules put the verb
  at the end of a clause, like German, or sometimes the end of a sentence, in
  dialects like this example in Swiss German:
</p>
<p>
  <em
    >Ich ha s Schlos, wo ich, wie so oft, z&#39;heftig, i mim Stress, wo wider
    mau passiert isch, verdr√§it ha, ufbroche.</em
  >
</p>
<p>which means:</p>
<p><em>I broke the lock, turning it too hard, in my usual panic</em></p>
<p>but is articulated something like:</p>
<p>
  <em
    >I have, the lock, which I, as so often, too forcefully, in my panic, again,
    turned have, broken.</em
  >
</p>
<p>
  That is,
  <strong
    >the listener has no idea what the sentence is about (breaking a lock) until
    the very last word</strong
  >.
</p>
<h3 id="our-hypothesis">Our Hypothesis</h3>
<p>
  When native speakers listen to sentences with the verb at the end, in the vast
  majority of cases, they know what it will be. LLMs work in exactly the same
  way. In fact the fundamental mechanism by which they appear to exhibit
  intelligence is in predicting the best possible work to come next given the
  prior context. We are going to stretch this predictive power to its absolute
  limits, so that we can guess from the context what speaker is about to say,
  and start translating earlier.
