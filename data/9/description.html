<ul>
  <li>
    Orchestrator distributes model layers across heterogeneous miners and
    streams activations between them.
  </li>
  <li>
    All network communication is mediated via the orchestrator, and a shared S3
    bucket is used to store activations and layer weights.
  </li>
  <li>
    Miners compete to process as many activations as possible in the training
    stage.
  </li>
  <li>
    Miners periodically upload their local weights and merge their activations
    using a variant of Butterfly All-Reduce.
  </li>
  <li>
    Validators spot-check miners to ensure that work was performed as required.
  </li>
