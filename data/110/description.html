<h2>Rich Kids of TAO</h2>
<p>Rich Kids of Tao is a Bittensor subnet designed to reward miners based on their emissions across multiple subnets, with the distribution weights determined by community voting. Unlike previous miner appreciation subnets, this project introduces a more adaptive and democratic approach, allowing existing miners (alpha holders) to vote on which subnets should be prioritized for rewards. Miners simply register to participate, while validators calculate and distribute rewards proportionally based on emissions, subnet prices, and community-assigned weights. The system aims to incentivize miner participation and ecosystem growth through transparent, community-driven reward allocation.</p>
