<h2>LUCID</h2>
<p>LUCID (Subnet 92) is where AI hallucinations become infinite narratives. We treat the "dreaming" state of Large Language Models not as a bug, but as a feature. By incentivizing distributed intelligence to weave logic into creative chaos, LUCID builds a decentralized engine for consistent world-building—powering the next generation of games, novels, and immersive realities.</p>
