Utilizing a four-stage pipeline—blueprint, characters, story arc, and chapters—Storynet enables both creators and developers to produce structured, choice-driven stories via a standard API. Miners contribute compute power to generate stories and are rewarded in $TAO based on a meritocratic, multi-dimensional scoring system that evaluates technical quality, structure, content, and narrative creativity. Anti-cheating mechanisms, including plagiarism detection and originality scoring, ensure content integrity and fairness within the network.",
