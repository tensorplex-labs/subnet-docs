<h2>Swap</h2>
<p>
  swap (sn10 on Bittensor) is a project designed to incentivize miners to
  provide liquidity to the TAO&lt;&gt;USDC pool on the Taofi platform. It
  implements a scoring mechanism where miners are evaluated based on the fees
  their liquidity positions have generated over the past 24 hours, encouraging
  active and effective liquidity provision. The project is open-source under the
  MIT license and provides clear instructions for installation and development
  setup, targeting contributors interested in decentralized finance and
  liquidity mining within the Bittensor ecosystem.
