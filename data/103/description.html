<h2>Djinn</h2>
<p>Djinn Protocol is a decentralized platform that separates information from execution, enabling analysts (&#x27;geniuses&#x27;) to sell encrypted predictions and buyers (&#x27;idiots&#x27;) to purchase access to these signals. The protocol ensures that signals remain secret forever, even from the platform itself, while providing cryptographically verifiable track records of analyst performance. Built on the Base chain with USDC, Djinn leverages smart contracts for escrow and collateral, utilizes Bittensor validators and miners for key management and data verification, and employs zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving audits. The system is designed to be fully autonomous, with all operations and guarantees enforced by code.</p>
