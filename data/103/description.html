  Mental-health conditions affect hundreds of millions of people, yet stigma,
  cost, and limited clinical capacity still keep timely help out of reach.
  HappyAI set out to change that by building Avocado—an AI companion that offers
  accessible, empathetic, and evidence-based support around the clock.
</p>
<p>
  Running on our Bittensor subnet, Avocado is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a
  week, ready whenever users reach for help. Each conversation is guided by
  proven Cognitive Behavioral Therapy principles, allowing the system to suggest
  practical exercises and reframing techniques that fit an individual’s
  situation. With advanced natural-language understanding, Avocado responds in a
  tone that feels human and supportive, adapting to the user’s emotional state
  rather than relying on canned replies.

<p>
  At every step we enforce rigorous safety-escalation protocols. If a user’s
  messages indicate crisis-level distress, Avocado immediately surfaces local
  helplines and, where permitted, can hand off to live professionals—ensuring
  empathy never comes at the expense of responsibility.
</p>
<p>
  This project is just the start. HappyAI will continue creating applications
  where responsible AI tangibly improves quality of life—whether in wellbeing,
  productivity, or daily care—always with the same focus on accessibility,
  personalization, and safety.
