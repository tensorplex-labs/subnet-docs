<h2>Liquidity</h2>
<p>Subnet77 is a liquidity mining and voting system designed for the Bittensor ecosystem, enabling token holders to vote on liquidity pools while validators process these votes to set miner weights on subnet 77. The system features a server that manages vote collection, weight calculation based on token holdings and liquidity positions, and provides RESTful APIs for interaction. Validators fetch calculated weights and update them on-chain, while miners can register their addresses, provide liquidity, and monitor rewards. The platform includes sophisticated vote cooldown management, transparent vote history, and integration with Uniswap V3 and Coingecko for real-time liquidity and price data.</p>
