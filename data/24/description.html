<h2>Quasar</h2>
<p>Quasar is a Bittensor subnet (Subnet 24) designed to overcome the long-context limitation in AI models by enabling efficient reasoning across millions of tokens in a single context window. Leveraging a novel continuous-time attention transformer architecture and optimized flash-linear attention kernels, Quasar achieves linear scaling, high retrieval accuracy, and significantly reduced inference costs. The project utilizes decentralized compute and a competitive mining environment, where independent miners optimize and verify model performance, with validators ensuring accuracy and rewarding top contributors with $TAO. Quasar&#x27;s open-source models are available for deployment and collaboration, supporting advanced applications like narrative understanding, codebase analysis, and legal review.</p>
