<h2 id="overview-what-is-bitkoop-">Overview – What is BitKoop?</h2>
<p>
  BitKoop is a decentralized, community-powered coupon platform that turns
  <strong>working discount codes</strong> into a reliable, verifiable commodity.
</p>
<p>
  Shoppers can discover <strong>verified coupons</strong> for a wide variety of
  products across multiple online stores — without wasting time on expired or
  fake offers.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike traditional coupon sites, BitKoop’s discount codes are sourced directly
  from its network of incentivized <strong>miners</strong> — community members
  who actively hunt for and submit valid discounts. Every coupon is
  <strong>tested, verified, and scored</strong> by independent validators before
  appearing on the platform.
</p>
<p>
  These miners earn rewards for every working code they contribute, creating a
  self-sustaining ecosystem where the more people participate, the more valuable
  the commodity — verified discount codes — becomes. By decentralizing the
  sourcing and standardizing the quality, BitKoop guarantees a constant flow of
  fresh, trustworthy offers while giving contributors a direct stake in the
  platform’s success.
</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Finding a working coupon is often:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Frustrating:</strong> Most codes are expired, fake, or misleading.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Time-consuming:</strong> Shoppers waste time testing multiple codes
    at checkout.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Non-transparent:</strong> Traditional coupon sites don’t tell you if
    a code works until you try it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Exploitative:</strong> Many platforms profit from your clicks even
    when no real discount exists.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-bitkoop-solution">The BitKoop Solution</h2>
<p>
  We reimagine the coupon economy with
  <strong>trust and transparency by default</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Community-sourced</strong>: All discount codes come from
    incentivized <strong>miners</strong> who actively find and submit working
    offers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Real-time validation</strong>: A network of independent validators
    tests and scores every code, ensuring only working discounts reach the
    platform.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Performance-based rewards</strong>: Miners and validators earn based
    on the value and accuracy of their contributions, creating a self-policing
    ecosystem.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>With BitKoop, if you see it — it works.</strong> No tricks, no wasted
  clicks.
</p>
<h2 id="the-market-opportunity">The Market Opportunity</h2>
<p>
  The online coupon and deals industry is a multi-billion-dollar market.
  Traditional coupon platforms like RetailMeNot, Honey, and Groupon collectively
  generate hundreds of millions in annual revenue — primarily through affiliate
  commissions and advertising. For example, Honey was acquired by PayPal in 2020
  for $4 billion, largely because of its ability to drive purchase decisions and
  capture affiliate revenue at scale.
</p>
<p>
  Yet, despite the massive earnings, these platforms suffer from low trust and
  poor user experience — with high bounce rates due to non-working codes and
  opaque referral practices. This leaves a significant gap for a transparent,
  performance-driven alternative.
</p>
<p>
  BitKoop is positioned to step directly into this market, leveraging the same
  proven revenue model (affiliate commissions from partner stores), but with a
  trust-first approach powered by decentralization and validation. Every
  verified code not only improves user satisfaction but also increases the
  likelihood of conversions — translating into higher revenue per user.
</p>
<p>
  With the coupon industry projected to continue growing alongside global
  e-commerce, BitKoop is targeting a share of a market worth tens of billions
  annually, while differentiating itself through community incentives,
  transparency, and measurable value creation.
</p>
<p>
  We aim to capture market share by delivering
  <strong>verified value</strong> in a space dominated by unreliable coupon
  sites.
