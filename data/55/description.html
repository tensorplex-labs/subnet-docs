<h2>NIOME: Privacy Safe Genomic Intelligence</h2>

<p>
  NIOME is a decentralized AI subnet operating on Bittensor that generates
  high-fidelity synthetic genomic data, enabling privacy-safe genomic
  intelligence for pharmaceutical research and precision medicine. By creating
  statistically accurate synthetic genomes that mimic real DNA without
  containing any actual personal data, NIOME overcomes privacy, consent, and
  regulatory barriers that limit access to large-scale genomic datasets. The
  platform incentivizes miners to generate novel synthetic genomic profiles,
  which are validated for quality and biological plausibility, and provides
  researchers and pharma companies with API access to customized,
  privacy-compliant datasets for drug response prediction, disease risk
  stratification, and biomarker discovery.
