<h2>Subnet 115</h2>
<p>Hashichain is a sovereign layer 1 blockchain infrastructure purpose-built to support the emerging agent economy, where autonomous AI agents interact and transact. Unlike traditional blockchains focused on deterministic, binary financial transfers, Hashichain introduces the concept of a probabilistic state machine, enabling the ledger to record intents rather than just asset movements. It leverages the Bittensor network and Yuma consensus for validating complex, probabilistic agent interactions, with miners acting as solver nodes running distributed AI models in secure environments. The protocol emphasizes privacy, coordination, and semantic compatibility, aiming to provide the foundational infrastructure for AI agents to connect, coordinate, and settle value autonomously.</p>
