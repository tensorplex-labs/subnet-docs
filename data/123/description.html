  MANTIS scores miners based on the information theoretical value of their
  embeddings to the prediction of BTCUSD.
</p>
<p>
  Incentives are distributed proprtional to a given miners contribution to the
  accuracy of a MLP that interprets these embeddings run by validators.
</p>
<p>
  Time to emissions depends entirely on how quickly the validator can learn how
  to interpret a given miners embeddings.
</p>
<p>
  This approach is in contrast to having miners produce and directly scoring
  them, it is superior in 2 primary ways:
</p>
<p>Synergy/Synthesis:</p>
<p>
  A set of embeddings which are not individually predictive, may carry
  predictive power when combined with others (such as with funding rate and open
  interest along with many other feature pairs, historically).
</p>
<p>
  In other words, additive individual evaluation cannot detect higher-order
  interactions, and is therefore unsuitable for incentivizing the highest
  quality NETWORK outputs.
</p>
<p>
  To provide an example, you could have a system that directly scores
  predictions, and a top set of 3 miners dominating the network, their
  accuracies are around 57%, and an ensemble of their outputs gets around 61%.
</p>
<p>
  You could have a miner that outputs 58% accuracy, and takes over the network,
  however it&#39;s underlying signal was already captured by the existing
  miners, and the network performance in fact, degrades.
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, you could have a system with 55% accuracy, that captures
  signal orthagonal to the existing strategies, and this could not stay
  registered with a linear system.
</p>
<p>
  MANTIS Solves this. MANTIS Is a framework for extracting the most accurate
  network performance for time series tasks. Our first being BTC forcasting.
