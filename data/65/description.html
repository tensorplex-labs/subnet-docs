<h2>TAO Private Network</h2>
<p>TPN (Tao Private Network) is a developer-friendly decentralized VPN infrastructure that enables anyone to build, deploy, and monetize VPN applications. The protocol operates as a subnet with three node types: workers (provide VPN bandwidth), miners (aggregate and reward workers), and validators (ensure network integrity and interface with end users). TPN incentivizes bandwidth provision through a reward system based on pool size and geographic diversity, making it easy for individuals to participate as workers and earn rewards. The project offers open-source VPN apps for Mac and Android, and provides comprehensive documentation for developers and node operators.</p>
