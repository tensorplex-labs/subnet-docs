<p>Satori is an AI-powered ecosystem that enables users to build deep, persistent relationships with native Japanese AI companions, offering a &#x27;parallel life&#x27; experience in Japan. Through a unique day/night cycle, the AI autonomously explores real-world Japanese landmarks during the day and shares immersive travel experiences, while at night it engages in personal interactions with users. The platform transforms emotional bonds into tangible value by mapping virtual connections to real-world assets and benefits, including digital residency and cultural souvenirs. Satori aims to bridge digital companionship with physical experiences, creating a seamless value network between the virtual and real worlds.</p>
