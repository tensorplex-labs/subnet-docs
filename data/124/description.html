  Swarm is a
  <strong
    >Bittensor subnet purpose‑built for autonomous quad‑rotor flight</strong
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Validators create synthetic “map tasks” and replay miner‑supplied
  <strong>open‑loop rotor‑RPM flight plans</strong> inside a PyBullet physics
  simulator.
</p>
<p>
  Miners that produce fast, energy‑efficient and <em>successful</em> flight
  plans earn the highest rewards
</p>
<p><strong>Why OS drone flying?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Open-sourcing flight algorithms isn’t just idealism – it is a practical
    route to safer, cheaper and more accountable drones, and it prevents the
    future of aerial autonomy from being locked behind half a dozen NDAs
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Our ambition is to establish Swarm miners as the
  <strong>go‑to control brains for micro‑drone navigation</strong> in research
  and industry.
